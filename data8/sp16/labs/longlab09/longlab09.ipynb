    "\n",
    "In lab 4, we ran an hypothesis test about the changes in murder rates over time.  That was the first part of the 3rd project in Data 8.  After that, students take advantage of a natural experiment to investigate the causal effect of the death penalty on murder rates.  In 1972, a Supreme Court decision suddenly banned the death penalty across the US.  A 1976 decision lifted the ban, reinstating the death penalty in many states.  Students come to the following conclusions (stated roughly here) using hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overall, the murder rate in a state is about as likely to increase as decrease year-over-year.\n",
    "2. After the death penalty was banned in 1972, the murder rate went up (more than we'd expect by chance) in the states where the death penalty had previously been in effect.\n",
    "3. After the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, the murder rate went down (more than we'd expect by chance) in the states where the death penalty came back into effect.\n",
    "4. In states that didn't have a death penalty, the Supreme Court decisions had no effect.  The murder rate was about as likely to increase as decrease year-over-year in this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis appears to favor the conclusion that the death penalty is associated with murder.  By looking at states that weren't affected by the sudden ban, we even have a sort of control group, so we could plausibly claim to have evidence that the death penalty *causes* a lower murder rate.  But [a 2006 Stanford Law Review paper](http://users.nber.org/~jwolfers/papers/DeathPenalty%28SLR%29.pdf) argues the opposite: that historical murder rates do **not** provide evidence that the death penalty deters murder.\n",
