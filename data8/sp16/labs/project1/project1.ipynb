    "Welcome to the first project in Data 8! We will be exploring possible connections between water usage, geography, and income in California. The water data for this project was procured from the [California State Water Resources Control Board](http://www2.pacinst.org/gpcd/table.html) and curated by the [Pacific Institute](http://pacinst.org/). The map data includes [US topography](https://github.com/jgoodall/us-maps), [California counties](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/tree/master/countries/USA/CA), and [ZIP codes](http://bl.ocks.org/jefffriesen/6892860).\n",

    "The dataset on income comes from the IRS ([documentation](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/13zpdoc.doc)).  We have identified some interesting columns in the dataset, but a full description of all the columns (and a definition of the population in the dataset and some interesting anonymization procedures they used) is available in this [description](irs_info.pdf).\n",

In other words, for any other column such as `'N02650'`, the value of `'N02650'` in a row corresponding to ZIP code 90210 (for example) should be the sum of the values of `'N02650'` in the 6 rows of `income_raw` corresponding to ZIP code 90210."
