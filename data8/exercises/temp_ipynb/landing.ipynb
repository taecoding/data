    "SpaceY, a company that builds and tests spacecraft, is testing a new reusable launch system.  Most spacecraft use a \"first stage\" rocket that propels a smaller payload craft away from Earth, then falls back to the ground and crashes.  SpaceY's new system is designed to land safely at a landing pad at a certain location, ready for later reuse.  If it doesn't land in the right location, it crashes, and the (very expensive) vehicle is destroyed.\n",

It's reasonable to think of these small errors as random.  That is, the landing locations are drawn from some distribution over locations on the surface of Earth, centered around the landing pad.\n",
