    "In a basketball game, each team scores some number of points.  Conventionally, the team playing at its own arena is called the \"home team,\" and the other team is called the \"away team.\"  The winner, of course, is the team with the most points.  So we could summarize what happened in a game by the following number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{outcome} = \\text{points scored by the away team} - \\text{points scored by the home team}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If this number is positive, the away team won.  If it's negative, the home team won.  For brevity, we'll use the shorthand **\"outcome\"** for **the away team's score minus the home team's score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Casinos in Las Vegas offer bets on the outcomes of NBA games.  One kind of bet works like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The casino decides on a \"spread.\"\n",
    "2. You can bet \\$11 that the outcome will be above the spread, or \\$11 that the outcome will be below the spread.\n",
    "3. After the game, you end up with \\$21 if you guessed correctly, and \\$0 if you guessed incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysts at the casino try to choose the spread so that (according to their analysis of the teams) there is a 50% chance that the outcome will be below that amount, and a 50% chance that the outcome will be above that amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "**[tl;dr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read): The spread is the casino's best guess at the outcome (the away team's score minus the home team's score).**\n",
