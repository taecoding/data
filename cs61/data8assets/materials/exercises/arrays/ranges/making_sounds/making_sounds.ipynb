    "Sound happens when an object moves back-and-forth very quickly, pushing the air around it and creating rapidly oscillating increases and decreases in that air's pressure.  These patterned disturbances in the air move outward in all directions from the object (at the \"speed of sound\").\n",
    "\n",
    "[This webpage](https://auditoryneuroscience.com/acoustics/sound_propagation) has a nice visual depiction of a sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a disturbance in the air reaches your ear, your ear detects the air pressure changing at a certain rate, and you hear a particular sound.  Which sound you hear depends on how quickly the pressure goes up and down.  Simple, repeated oscillations sound like single musical *notes* to humans.  If the pressure goes up and down 220 times per second, you hear a note musicians call \"A below middle C\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the changes in air pressure that your brain interprets as sound are very *small* and *fast* relative to the kinds of pressure you can feel, say, on your skin.  Ears are sensitive, specialized instruments for detecting small, fast oscillations in pressure."

    "\n",

In a video, a sequence of still pictures creates the illusion of continuous movement.  In the same way, your brain interprets a quick sequence of different pressures as a continuous sound.\n",
