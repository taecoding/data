    "Welcome to lab 10!  This lab is based on a homework problem from the 5th week of the course.  You'll combine together several datasets to show that places near water have more moderate (less variable) climates.  There is less focus on inferential questions, and more on \"wrangling\" the data, using important tools like `join` and `apply`.  If you don't have prior programming experience, don't expect to finish this lab in an hour.\n",

    "# 1. Climate and water\n",
    "To get more practice analyzing data with tables, you'll work with a dataset about climate.  Theory says that land masses near large bodies of water have more moderate temperatures, since the water cools the land when it's hot and warms it when it's cold.  You'll be investigating whether that means places near coastlines have smaller daily temperature fluctuations than places far away from coastlines.\n",

    "The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operates thousands of weather stations (mostly in the US) that collect information about local climate.  Among other things, each station records the highest and lowest observed temperature each day.  These data, called \"Quality Controlled Local Climatological Data,\" are publicly available [here](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/orders/qclcd/) and described [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/quality-controlled-local-climatological-data-qclcd).\n",

    "* The main dataset is a sample of all the daily readings from 2015.  (There were half a million total readings in the original dataset, but that takes some time to process, so we've sampled it for you.)  These are in a table called `daily_temp.csv`.  Each row corresponds to one day at one station, and includes the maximum and minimum temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) for that day, the day (in MonthDay format), and an identifier, called a WBAN (Weather Bureau Army Navy) ID, for the station that made the reading.  When you read this into a Table, call it `daily_temp`.\n",
    "* A separate table, called `stations.csv`, contains information about each station.  In particular, it gives the global coordinates (latitude and longitude) of each station, identified by WBAN ID.  Call this Table `stations`.  **Note:** `stations.csv` actually uses the pipe character (\"`|`\") to separate values, rather than commas.  To read it, use `Table.read_table(\"stations.csv\", sep=\"|\")` .\n",
    "* A third table, called `coast_distance.csv`, tells us roughly how far away every place on Earth (to a precision of half a degree latitude/longitude) is from a coastline.  The data come from [a NASA project](http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/DOCS/DistFromCoast/).  Call this table `coast_distance`.\n",
