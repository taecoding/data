We're going to put stations into three groups: close to coast (less than 50 km from a coast), sort of near a coast (50 to 250 km from a coast), and very far inland (\\>250 km from a coast).  And we'll compute the average max temperature instead of the average spread.  This will let us see if coastal areas have lower average temperatures, in addition to smaller variation in temperature.\n",
