More precisely, we have a list of approximately 5000 words.  For each of these words, for each song, each item in the table describes the proportion of the song's lyrics that are the particular word.\n",

Similarly, the word \"love\" appears 10 times: $\\frac{10}{168} \\approx 0.0595$ of the words. Therefore, `lyrics.where(\"Title\", \"In Your Eyes\").column(\"like\").item(0)` is about $0.0119$, and `lyrics.where(\"Title\", \"In Your Eyes\").column(\"love\").item(0)` is about $0.0595$.\n",
