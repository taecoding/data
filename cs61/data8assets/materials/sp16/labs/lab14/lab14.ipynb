    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a known population, like all dogs in California.  So far, we've seen 3 ways of *predicting* something about an individual in that population, given incomplete knowledge about the identity of the individual:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we know nothing about the individual dog, we could predict that its speed is the *average* or *median* of all the speeds in the population.\n",
    "* If we know the dog's height but not its speed, we could use *linear regression* to predict its speed from its height.  The resulting prediction is still imperfect, but it might be more accurate than the population average.\n",
    "* If we know the dog's breed, height, and age, we could use *nearest-neighbor classification* to predict its speed by comparing to a collection of dogs with known speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing conditional probabilities is a different way of making predictions.  It differs in at least two important ways from the methods we've seen:\n",
    "1. Rather than producing definite answers that might be wrong, we \"hedge our bets\" and figure out how likely each possible answer is. That is, we predict a distribution over outcomes.\n",
    "2. In the simple (but important) cases we'll look at today, conditional probabilities can be calculated exactly from assumptions rather than estimated from data.  There are many techniques for classification, and even once we choose `k`-Nearest Neighbors, we get different results for different values of `k`.  But there is only one correct way to compute a conditional probability."
